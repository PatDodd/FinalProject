##FinalProject: Vinyl Libary
#####Node/Hapi.js Web App (FinalProject for ITC298 &amp; Capstone)

Using the Hapi.js framework with Node.js, I built a web app to keep track of which 
albums I've loaned out to my pals. Admins can delete, add (using the Spotify Web API), 
and return albums. Regular users can log-in to browse my libary, view track info, and
checkout records.
